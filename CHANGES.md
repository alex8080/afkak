Version 2.5.0
-------------

* Detect blocked reactor and log an Error

Version 2.4.0
-------------

* Actually fix `BPSO-10628`: Resolve hostnames to IPs for all
  configured hosts. Client will still return error on first failure,
  but will re-resolve before making further requests. High level
  Consumer and Producer retry.

Version 2.3.0
-------------

* Resolve hostnames to IPs for all configured hosts. `BPSO-10628`.

Version 2.2.0
-------------

* Add Kafka 0.9.0.1 compatibility. `BPSO-17091`.

Version 2.1.1
-------------

* Switch to warnings.warn for failure to import native-code Murmur
  hash `BPSO-13212`.

Version 2.1.0
-------------

* Fixed bug where Afkak would raise a KeyError when a commit failed
  `BPSO-11306`
* Added `request_retry_max_attempts` parameter to Consumer objects
  which allows the caller to configure the maximum number of attempts
  the Consumer will make on any request to Kafka. `BPSO-10531`
  NOTE: It defaults to zero which indicates the Consumer should retry
  forever. *This is a behavior change*.
* If a user-initiated Commit operation is attempted while a commit is
  ongoing (even a Consumer auto-initiated one), the new attempt will
  fail with a OperationInProgress error which contains a deferred
  which will fire when the previous Commit operation completes. This
  deferred *should* be used to retry the Commit since the ongoing
  operation may not include the latest offset at the time the second
  operation was initiated.
* Fixed an error where Commit requests would only be retried once
  before failing.
* Reduced the level of some log messages from ERROR to WARNING or
  lower. `BPSO-11309`
* Added `update_cluster_hosts` method to allow retargeting Afkak
  client in case all brokers are restarted on new IPs. `BPSO-3521`
* Fixed bug where Afkak would continue to try to contact brokers at IP
  addresses they no longer listened on, or brokers which had been
  removed from the cluster. `BPSO-6790`

Version 2.0.0
-------------

* message processor callback will recieve Consumer object
  with which it was registered

Version 1.0.2
-------------

* Fixed bug where message keys weren't sent to Kafka
* Fixed bug where producer didn't retry metadata lookup
* Fixed hashing of keys in HashedPartitioner to use Murmur2, like Java
* Shuffle the broker list when sending broker-unaware requests
* Reduced Twisted runtime requirement to 13.2.0
* Consolidated tox configuration to one tox.ini file
* Added logo
* Cleanup of License, ReadMe, Makefile, etc.

Version 1.0.1
-------------

* Added Twisted as install requirement
* Readme augmented with better install instructions
* Handle testing properly without 'Snappy' installed

Version 1.0.0
-------------

* Working offset committing on 0.8.2.1
* Full coverage tests
* Examples for using producer & consumer

Version 0.1.0
